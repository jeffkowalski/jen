* Certificate installation
** Run the following command to create a private key:
 openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048
** Use the following command to generate a certificate. Specify the names you used for your private-key.pem and configuration.cnf files:
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 \
            -key private-key.pem \
            -config configuration.cnf \
            -out certificate.pem
This produces a self-signed certificate in a file called certificate.pem.
** Save the certificate .pem, private key .pem, and the configuration .cnf files in a safe place, then update the skill configuration with the certificate.
